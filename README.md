## Overview

This repository contains my coursework and reference materials from **DSC-260: Data Visualization and Modeling**.  
All **Applied Exercises (AE)** and **Homework (HW)** files represent *my own student work*.  
All other files (unlabeled `.R`, `.qmd`, `.csv`, etc.) are **instructor-provided examples or starter code** used for reference and learning. 

Work in this repository focuses on reproducible data visualization, modeling, and statistical analysis using **R**, **tidyverse**, and **tidymodels**.
